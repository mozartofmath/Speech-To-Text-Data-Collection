        ## Introduction
        Speech recognition technology allows for hands-free control of smartphones, speakers, and even vehicles in a 
        wide variety of languages. Companies have moved towards the goal of enabling machines to understand and respond 
        to more and more of our verbalized commands. There are many matured speech recognition systems available, 
        such as Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and Appleâ€™s Siri. However, all of those voice assistants work for 
        limited languages only.
        
        Our responsibility was to build a deep learning model that is capable of transcribing a speech to text in the 
        Amharic language. The model we produce will be accurate and is robust against background noise.
        
        In order to make our model more accurate, we need more data. We would like to thank you for participating.''')
